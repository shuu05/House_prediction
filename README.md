# House Value Prediction

**This is a machine learning model for house value prediction based on Boston housing datasets. **

> It is based on labelled data so it is a supervised learning model where we uses regression technique to predict the estimated value of the houses with minimum errors.

| Data          | Type          | Model         |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Labelled      | `Supervised`  | Regression    |


> It uses many types of regression techinque like linear regression,Decision tree,random forest out of which we come to conclusion that random forest regression is suited best for this model with minimum errors.

**Steps to choose model for our data**

> we are assuming that we got all the required data and it is preprocessed,then  we have to ask all the below questions and get the answers.

**steps**

* Is our data  labelled ? i.e, if labelled then it is supervise else unsupervised.
* What to do ?(i.e, do we have to preform prediction or classificatio or regression or time series).
* model selection (for this we have to apply different types of models and check which is suited best for our model).
